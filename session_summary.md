# Session Summary: Key Features Implemented

This document summarizes the key features and fixes implemented during our recent pair programming session.

## 1. Audio and TTS Enhancements
- **Background Music:** Resolved an issue to ensure background music plays correctly when the experience starts.
- **Prologue Narration:** Integrated ElevenLabs TTS to provide voice narration for the prologue, enhancing the introduction. The system now uses streaming for TTS playback.

## 2. Visual Effects and UI Improvements
- **Color-Changing Eye:** The central eye in the intro sequence now features a dynamic, continuously changing color effect via its point light.
- **Card Sizing:** The "Destiny Card" selection UI was improved by increasing the size of the cards for better visibility.
- **Dramatic Phase Transition:** A new transition sequence was created for moving from the dialogue phase to the MediaPipe phase. It includes:
    - A TTS voiceover stating, "너의 선택을 존중한다. 이제 너의 생각을 표현하라!"
    - A "warp drive" camera effect in the Three.js scene, making the user feel like they are flying through space.
    - A full-screen text overlay that displays the TTS message during the transition.

## 3. Core Gameplay: Dilemma and Dialogue System
A major overhaul of the dialogue phase was completed, replacing the initial card-based chat with a multi-stage dilemma system inspired by a VR experience.

- **Dilemma Scenarios:** Three distinct dilemmas (A: Wealth vs. Security, B: Sacrifice vs. Morality, C: Self vs. Humanity) were implemented based on the provided script.
- **Mimir, the LLM Persona:** The LLM now embodies the persona of "Mimir," a wise being who questions the user's choices. The system prompt for the LLM has been carefully crafted to:
    - Ask deep, probing questions about the user's motivations (e.g., "Why did you make that choice?").
    - Always use informal language (반말).
- **Turn-Based Dialogue:** Each dilemma conversation is now limited to 5 turns (user message + Mimir's response). After the 5th turn, the conversation automatically concludes and moves to the next stage.
- **UI Overhaul:** The UI for this phase was completely rebuilt to first present the dilemma and choices, and then switch to a dedicated chat interface for the conversation with Mimir.

## 4. Bug Fixes
- **UI Overlap:** Fixed a bug where the dialogue UI remained visible and overlapped with the final transition overlay, ensuring a clean visual experience.
